  "CareerInfo": "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).",

  "ReportTwo": "There is consumer demand for fresh, locally grown foods, but there is a disconnection between wanting those goods and the ease of purchasing them. For instance, if you are working Saturday mornings or are busy otherwise and miss the local farmers market, it is tough to find and buy locally grown fresh food.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 35% of Americans work on weekend days. Besides the farmers market, there are limited options to find locally sourced food. With Farm to Table connecting farmers and consumers, more farmers will be able to profit off of their food, and more consumers will be able to enjoy the benefits of eating local.To know more about 'How Farm to Table Business Model is affecting the Food Tech Sector', keep reading this blog.",
